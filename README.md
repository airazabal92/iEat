# iEat

## Description

This application lets users input their dietary restrictions, calories, and diet type to generate a weekly meal plan with recipe instructions and list of all ingredients needed to go shopping with.

Recipes are generated by making a call to the Spoonacular API. The user's dietary restrictions, calroies, and diet type information is used to generate the 21 recipes. Then, 21 API calls are made to get the recipe image, source URL, and ingredients - including the type, amount, and quantity.

The ingredient list includes the ingredient, amount, and quantity and is separated by recipe. This list can be used to make shopping easier for the user because they do not need to go to each individual recipe to see the ingredients.
